{"title":"Mobile Photography","content":"A collection of photos all shot on various mobiles. I am no professional photographer and I am quite bad at learning it by any method apart from sheer trial and error. None of these images (so far) have been edited beyond whatever the phone automatically does. A drastic increase in quality did happen when I got a phone with a better camera and post processing.","chennai_metro":{"description":"St. Thomas Metro Station at Chennai at sunset.
