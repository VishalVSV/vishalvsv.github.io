I am a physics student currently at UM DAE CEBS at Mumbai. I love taking things apart both digitally, physically, analytically and maybe even metaphorically. I used to debate. I still write a lot of code and I play the drums. I also love playing indie games and watching anime. I am avid reader who is going through a bit of a slump :-(.
