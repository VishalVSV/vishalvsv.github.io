I am a physics student currently at UM DAE CEBS at Mumbai. I love taking things apart digitally, physically, analytically and maybe even metaphorically. I used to debate. I still write a lot of code and I play the drums. I love playing indie games and watching anime. I am avid reader, going through a bit of a slump :-(.

Did I mention I love writing code? I have a soft spot in my heart for text based rendering and use it as much as I can. There's an example right here!
