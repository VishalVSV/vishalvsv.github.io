Let's talk video games.

I am a pretty avid gamer. I've played loads of genres from FPS games to RPGs to platformers. I've always had a game or two ongoing at any point in my life. As such I've played a lot of good games and a lot of really average games. However, recently in the last few years I gained the ability to buy games with my own money due to the odd stage in life called college. This new found freedom and my innate inability to spend more than a couple hundred rupees at a time led me to indie games. I've played a few indie games before like Terraria and Minecraft but it was purely due to their popularity and less out of interest or enjoyment. They were good games to play with others and Terraria did leave a lasting impact on me but they were not the same as the Indie games I found later in life. My first Indie game was Hyper Light Drifter. An incredible art style combined with one of the most unique and incredible soundtracks blew me away. I had bought the game for hardly 500 rupees which is like 6 dollars and I was simply blown away. It left me wondering if I had somehow gotten away with theft because I knew in my heart that the game was worth more than that. However, with time the feeling went away and I didn't think too much about the game but it did lead me to buy lots and lots of cheap indie games because I was curious to see what independent game developers could make. I played a series of games since then such as Papers, Please, Oxygen Not Included, Celeste, Hollow Knight (yet to finish, Traitor Lord is brutal :( ), Journey, Firewatch and so on. All these games were incredible and made me realize that a developer's creativity was not a function of their funding.

Now we get to Citizen Sleeper.

I bought the game on sale along with another game because the bundle was cheap. I didn't read the store page and didn't really look at reviews. I just bought it and then it said it was a good game to play between work so I got intrigued and booted it up. Immediately I realized that it wasn't like any of the games I had played before. I had played games like XCOM that were turn based strategies that relied on luck but I never had a table top dice system in a game before. I had never played any TTRPGs either so the experience was fresh. Then I read the dialogue in Citizen Sleeper. That's when I realized I had stumbled onto a masterpiece unlike any other game I'd ever played before.

I am a reader by heart. I used to love novels and used to read a few books every month. At some point I lost the habit was couldn't really pick up a book anymore but my love for them remained. Citizen Sleeper's dialogue and story writing brought back every single thing I missed in books and gave me an experience that I had never had in any of the hundreds of books I had read upto then.
